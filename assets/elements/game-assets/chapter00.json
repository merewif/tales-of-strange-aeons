  "line 3: Ana took a deep breath to take in the calm of the world.",

  "line 4: She closed her eyes to relish the moment and tried, but a nagging thought at the back of her mind kept her keen and alert.",

  "line 5: “Right,” she thought as she shook her head to return to reality. “I can’t sit around idle either.”",

  "line 6: Her skirt fluttering and blowing up in the wind of the fall would definitely be less than ladylike.",

  "line 8: But the sensation of gravity weighing on her, the adrenaline rushing into her mind, the wind buffeting her skin was too alluring to end it so abruptly.",

  "line 9: She fell and shifted her body to see the skydock grow ever more distant as she neared the ground.",
