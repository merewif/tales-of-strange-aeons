  "High above the Nameless Colony of Mars, dangling her legs twenty thousand feet above the city, the cold, fresh air filling her lungs and chilling her skin, Ana Mionar marveled at the sight of the city and felt utterly blessed for the life she was given.",

  "Hundreds of thousands of Cloudwalkers passed by one another in the chaotic air trafic but none of them ever collided.",

  "Millions mingled on the commercial streets without a single occurrence of crime.",

  "Everyone performed their jobs with the utmost efficiency and with the will to the virtue of productive work.",

  "Citizens and visitors alike respected one another as brothers and sisters.",

  "Patches of color and groups of similar architecture deliniated the tens of thousands of independent neighborhoods that offered everyone a place to belong.",

  "There was no crime and no violence, no misery and want, no aging and no illness, no war, no ruling elite, <i>no death</i>.",

  "Ana took a deep breath to take in the calm of the world.",

  "She closed her eyes to relish the moment and tried, but a nagging thought at the back of her mind kept her keen and alert.",

  "“Right,” she thought as she shook her head to return to reality. “I can’t sit around idle either.”",

  "She stretched out her legs to get the blood puming and put her hands on the floor besides herself.",

  "“There is still work to do,” she thought and and pushed herself away from the edge of the skydock into the abyss."
